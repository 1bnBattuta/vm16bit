# 16-Bit Virtual Machine (VM)

This is a personal project to build a 16-bit virtual CPU from scratch using Python.

## Goals

- Learn about CPU architecture, instruction sets, memory models, and assembly language.
- Build a custom assembly language and assembler.
- Extend the system with a C compiler backend in the future.

## How to Run

1. Install Python 3.10+.
2. Run the virtual machine using `src/vm.py` (once populated).
3. Add your own programs in the `programs/` folder.

## Project Layout

- `src/`: Virtual machine core code
- `assembler/`: Assembler to convert `.asm` to bytecode or hexcode
- `programs/`: Assembly source code for sample programs
- `docs/`: Design notes, dev log, and future plans
- `tests/`: Unit tests
